**User (Passenger) Logic:**

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users create accounts with their personal information (name, email, phone number).
   - Implement authentication to secure user data.

2. **User Profile:**
   - Allow users to view and edit their profiles.
   - Store user details, payment methods, and preferences.

3. **Location Services:**
   - Users can share their current location using GPS or manually enter an address.
   - Implement geocoding and reverse geocoding to translate addresses into coordinates and vice versa.

4. **Requesting a Ride:**
   - Users can request rides by specifying a pickup location and a destination.
   - Validate the location data and match the user with a nearby available driver.

5. **Ride Matching and Dispatching:**
   - Determine the closest available drivers to the pickup location.
   - Match a driver with a passenger and send a ride request to the driver.

6. **Real-time Tracking:**
   - Enable users to track the driver's location in real-time on a map.
   - Update the estimated time of arrival.

7. **Notifications:**
   - Send notifications to users about ride status, driver details, and payment receipts.

8. **Payment Processing:**
   - Handle payments for rides through integrated payment gateways.
   - Store transaction records and billing information.

**Driver Logic:**

1. **Driver Registration and Authentication:**
   - Drivers create accounts with personal and vehicle information.
   - Implement driver authentication and background checks.

2. **Driver Profile:**
   - Allow drivers to view and update their profiles.
   - Store driver information, vehicle details, and payment preferences.

3. **Availability Status:**
   - Enable drivers to set their availability for accepting ride requests.
   - Update driver status (available, on a ride, offline).

4. **Accepting Ride Requests:**
   - Drivers receive ride requests and can accept or decline them.
   - Show ride details, including pickup and drop-off locations.

5. **Navigation:**
   - Provide drivers with navigation instructions to reach the passenger's pickup location and the destination.
   - Utilize real-time traffic data to optimize routes.

6. **Ride Completion:**
   - Allow drivers to mark a ride as completed when the passenger reaches the destination.
   - Calculate and display fare information.

7. **Earnings and Payments:**
   - Track driver earnings for completed rides.
